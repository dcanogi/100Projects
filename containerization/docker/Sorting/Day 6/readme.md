# Day 6: Set Up Persistent Storage for Docker Containers

## Objective
The objective of this project is to configure persistent storage for Docker containers, ensuring data retention between container restarts. This will enable our applications to maintain their state and data across restarts, providing a more robust deployment.

## Key Concepts
- **Docker Volumes**: Understanding the use of volumes to persist data outside of the container's filesystem.
- **Data Retention**: Exploring the importance of maintaining state in applications, such as databases or file storage.
- **Volume Drivers**: Learning about different volume drivers available in Docker for various storage backends.

## Deliverables
- An updated `docker-compose.yml` file that incorporates persistent storage for one or more services.
- Verification that data persists even after container restarts.

## Example Structure
1. **Service Definition**: Define a service that requires persistent storage in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. **Volume Configuration**: Create a volume that maps to the desired location within the container.
3. **Data Verification**: Implement a method to verify that data persists after restarting the container.

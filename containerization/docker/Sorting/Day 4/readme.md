# Day 4: Create a Docker Compose File for a Multi-Container Application

## Objective
The goal of this project is to effectively manage multiple containers using Docker Compose. We will define a multi-container application that simplifies the deployment and orchestration of our services.

## Key Concepts
- **Docker Compose**: A tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- **Service Definition**: Specify each service's configuration, including images, networks, and volumes.
- **Networking**: Facilitate communication between containers using Docker networks.

## Deliverables
- A well-structured `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the necessary services.
- Proper configuration to ensure all containers can communicate seamlessly.

## Example Structure
1. **Web Service**: An application server serving static files or a frontend.
2. **Database Service**: A database container to support data storage needs.
3. **Network Configuration**: Define a custom network to enable service discovery.

## Next Steps
- Explore additional Docker Compose features, such as scaling services and environment variable management.

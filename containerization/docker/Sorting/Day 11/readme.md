# Project 11: Multi-Container Application with Docker Compose

## Objective
This project aims to create a multi-container application using Docker Compose. It sets up two services: an Nginx server to serve a static HTML page and a PostgreSQL database to simulate a backend dependency.

## Key Concepts
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a single `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Nginx**: A high-performance web server that serves static content.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system that handles data storage and retrieval.

## Deliverables
- A complete `docker-compose.yml` file that defines both the web and database services.
- Verification that the Nginx server correctly serves the static HTML page and that the PostgreSQL database is operational.

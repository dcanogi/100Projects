# Day 5: Configure Networking Between Docker Containers with Docker Compose

## Objective
The aim of this project is to enable seamless communication between multiple containers within a Docker Compose network. By setting up an appropriate network configuration, we will ensure that our services can interact effectively.

## Key Concepts
- **Docker Networking**: Understanding the default network behavior of Docker Compose and how to customize it.
- **Service Discovery**: Utilizing service names for communication between containers without needing IP addresses.
- **Isolation**: Exploring the benefits of isolating containers within specific networks.

## Deliverables
- An updated `docker-compose.yml` file that configures a custom network for the services.
- Verification of container communication through networked service names.

## Example Structure
1. **Service Definition**: Define multiple services in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. **Custom Network**: Create a user-defined bridge network to facilitate inter-container communication.
3. **Service Interaction**: Implement a test to verify that containers can reach each other using their service names.

## Next Steps
- Explore advanced networking options such as overlay networks and container aliases.
- Implement health checks for services to ensure they are ready before communication occurs.

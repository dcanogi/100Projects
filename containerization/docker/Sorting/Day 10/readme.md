# Day 10: Add a Frontend Service to Your Multi-Service Application

## Objective
The objective of this project is to set up a simple frontend application using a framework such as React and connect it to the existing Node.js backend service. This integration will allow users to interact with the backend through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Concepts
- **Frontend Frameworks**: Understanding how to use modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React) within a Dockerized environment.
- **API Communication**: Implementing RESTful communication between the frontend and backend services.
- **Dockerfile Configuration**: Creating Dockerfiles for building and serving the frontend application.

## Deliverables
- An updated `docker-compose.yml` file that includes the frontend service.
- A Dockerfile for the frontend application to build and serve static files.
- Verification that the frontend can successfully communicate with the Node.js backend and display data.

## Example Structure
1. **Service Definitions**: Define the frontend service in the `docker-compose.yml` file alongside the existing Node.js and MongoDB services.
2. **Dockerfile Creation**: Create a Dockerfile for the React application to build the production-ready frontend.
3. **API Integration**: Implement API calls in the frontend application to fetch data from the Node.js backend.
